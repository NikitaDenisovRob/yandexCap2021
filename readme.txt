Hello everyone!

I took part in YandexCup 2021(mobile track) there was trial round, and last task was "Hidden message"

It sounds like: 
	Studying the planet Nibubu, Vasily made a grandiose discovery: he found rock paintings in one of the caves. All of them consisted only of light and dark squares of the same size. After much thought, the researcher figured out how to decode the drawings. It turned out that each square is one bit: a light color means 0, and a dark one - 1. Vasily decided to consider the light color the one whose sum of components is greater than or equal to 10, and the dark one - less than 10. Vasily took groups of 8 bits and converted them to a decimal number, after which he checked against the ASCII table and received a letter. So the researcher deciphered the first five messages, and there are a hundred more to come!

Help Vasily to decode all the inscriptions.

Note (I would say WARNING): A null byte (00000000) denotes the end of the message and is not included in the response.

They gave a solution, but given soulution taked 12ms and 1.11mb in final test
I wrote my own algorithm and it taked 6ms and 628.00kb in final test
So mb my code looks a little bit ridiculous,but  i think it's okay, i've been learning swift only for 1 week
